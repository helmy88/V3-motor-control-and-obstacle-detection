Project: Maker Mini Sumo Controller Robot with Obstacle Detection

Description:
This project demonstrates the control of a robot using the Maker Mini Sumo Controller via serial communication. It allows you to send commands to control the robot's movements (forward, backward, left, right, stop) and includes obstacle detection using an analog sensor.

1. Requirements:
- Maker Mini Sumo Controller
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- USB cable for connecting the Arduino to your computer
- Motors and motor drivers compatible with your robot
- Obstacle detection sensor (analog or digital)

2. Installation:
- Connect the Maker Mini Sumo Controller's RX pin to the Arduino's TX pin (rxPin and txPin in the code).
- Connect the motors and motor drivers to the appropriate pins on the Arduino (leftMotorPin and rightMotorPin).
- Connect the obstacle detection sensor to the analog pin specified by sensorPin.

3. Usage:
- Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
- Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
- Use the Maker Mini Sumo Controller to send commands ('S', 'F', 'B', 'L', 'R') via serial communication to control the robot's movements.
- The Serial Monitor will display the current status and any obstacle detection notifications.

4. Motor Control:
- The code includes functions to control the motors based on the received commands.
- Customize the motor control logic within the functions for desired movement behavior.

5. Obstacle Detection:
- The code reads sensor values to detect obstacles.
- If the sensor value is above the specified threshold, an "Obstacle Detected!" notification is displayed, and the motors are stopped.

6. Troubleshooting:
- Ensure proper wiring connections between the Maker Mini Sumo Controller, motors, motor drivers, sensors, and the Arduino.
- Double-check that the correct pins are specified in the code for communication and motor control.
- Calibrate and test sensors separately to ensure accurate obstacle detection.
